{"name":"Cog","tagline":"Cog is a tool for comparing languages using lexicostatistics and comparative linguistics techniques. It can be used to automate much of the process of comparing word lists from different language varieties.","body":"Features\r\n--------\r\n\r\n- IPA-based segmentation: automatically splits words in to segments\r\n- Stem identification: identifies prefixes and suffixes so that they can be ignored during\r\ncomparison\r\n- Word alignment: aligns segments between word pairs\r\n- Sound correspondence identification: automatically identifies sound correspondences and the\r\nenvironments in which they occur\r\n- Cognate identification: provides various methods for identifying cognates\r\n- Lexical/phonetic similarity: calculates lexical/phonetic similarity for multiple language\r\nvarieties\r\n- Visualization: generates similarity matrices, hierarchical graphs (UPGMA, Neighbor-joining), and\r\nnetwork graphs\r\n\r\nExperimentation\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe goal of Cog is to provide a framework for experimenting with different techniques for language\r\nvariety comparison. It is intended to be used iteratively: run a comparison, analyze the results,\r\nrefine the process, run the comparison again, and so on. Most steps in the process can be tailored.\r\nIt currently only supports a few comparison techniques, but we hope to include many more in the\r\nfuture.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
